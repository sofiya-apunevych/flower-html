  <p>
  From wide, open spaces to quiet, secluded corners, city parks provide
   a much-needed sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of busy city life.
    But, offering more than just a place to take a break, many parks are
     in fact major attractions in their own right, known as much for their
     landscaping, as they are for their art and culture.

  Seamlessly integrating the great outdoors into cig city life, parks
  connect natural spaces with built environments, combining beautiful
  meadows, ponds, lakes and stream with museums and other man-made
  attractions. And the best part? Most of them are free.

<div id="Melbourne">
   <h2>Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne</h2>
<p>
   Starting right here at home in Australia, the picturesque Royal Botanic
   Gardens in Melbourne spread out over almost 100 acres of colourful
   tropical flora and fauna. With a significant and diverse collection
   of 50 000 plants, as well as native black swans, kookaburras and cockatoos,
    visitors can get a close look at a variety of delicate camellia, cacti
     and cycads. Peaceful lakes and sprawling lawns make for enjoyable
     nature tours, while outdoor theatre and exhibitions in the summer
     months are a must see.

<div id="London">
  <h2>Hyde Park, London</h2>
  <p>
Perhaps the most famous park in a city full of famous parks, Hyde Park
was originally built as Henry VIII’s hunting grounds. One of eight royal
 parks within London, Hyde Park is one of the biggest and often finds
  visitors renting a rowboat or paddleboat to explore the legendary
  Serpentine Lake, or even taking a dip in its waters in the warmer
   summer months and then soaking up the sun on its shores. Also known
   for its alfresco concerts and its infamous Speakers’ Corner, take time
    out to listen to the public opinions of gifted orators.   An oasis
    of green in the midst of a concrete jungle, an urban park is essential
    to the lifeblood of any city, representing an opportunity to slow
    down and reconnect with more than just nature, but humanity too.

In today’s environment, achieving the perfect balance seems like an
 impossible task. Asset Management for local governments is a critical
 resource knowledge tool to keep the communities they service living
 the lives they are accustomed to from an infrastructure support basis.

Service utilities, transport, infrastructure, including parks, and so
much more, all require rigid asset performance assessment. With such
 a diverse range of assets to manage, AssetFinda provides a tailored
  government system that can encapsulate all asset classes, including
  the full asset lifecycle, broken down into specific business unit
   needs to plan for the present and predict future demands.

<div id="Barcelona">
<h2>Parc Guell, Barcelona</h2>
<p>
No list of city parks would be complete without making mention of
Barcelona’s Parc Güell. Designed by world-renowned architect,
 Antoni Gaudì, and inspired by natural forms, the park features
 elaborate, organic-looking architecture, decorated with vibrant,
 colourful mosaics that is an absolute joy to behold. Gingerbread
  houses, vaulted colonnades and welcoming benches all work

  together to create an entirely whimsical effect that encourages
  the visitor to explore the twisting pathways toward the Casa
  Museu Gaudí. Situated at the top of a terraced hill, the park
   overlooks the city and offers a panoramic view of the bay.

<div>
<h2 id="SanPaulo">Ibirapuera Park, San Paulo</h2>
<p>
  Often compared to New York City’s Central Park, Brazil’s Ibirapuera
   Park was built in 1954 to commemorate the city’s 400th anniversary.
    World-renowned Brazilian architect, Oscar Niemeyer, designed many
    of the signature buildings, including the flying-saucer-like planetarium
    and the auditorium, which is used for concerts. A centre of activity,
    the park is home to palaces and even an aquarium, and often sees people
    jogging and cycling along its paths and bridges, or sunbathing near
     the duck pond with a book from the park’s own library. Offering
      panoramic views of the city, the park is a vision of rolling
      lawns and fantastic buildings.

<div id="NewYork">
  <h2>Central Park, New York City</h2>
  <p>
    Covering 843 acres in the heart of New York city, Central Park is not
    only one of the world’s most famous parks, having made its appearance
     in countless movies, but it’s one of the most beautiful too.
     Providing an escape from the hustle and bustle of the city that
     never sleeps, visitors can explore meandering pathways and woodland
      areas, picnic in open meadows, get their exercise in, or even take
      a rowboat out for a spin on one of its peaceful lakes. The concept
      of “a shared backyard” has never rung more true than when it comes
      to Central Park, and no visit to New York is complete without
       an afternoon spent lounging on its lawns.

<h3>6 Ways to Spend an Evening in the Parks</h3>
<p>Skip the sunburn, beat the crowds and enjoy a magical part of the day by
visiting Three Rivers Parks in the evening or at night — most parks are
 open daily until 10 PM. Here are six free or low-cost ways to enjoy the
 beauty of the parks after prime daytime hours:
 </p>
<ol>
<li> Paddle under the light of a full moon.
<a href="#MoonWay">More...</a></li>
<li>See the stars
<a href="#StarWay">More...</a></li>
  <li>Go on a sunset-viewing date.
  <a href="#DateWay">More...</a></li>
<li>Try a family photo adventure.
<a href="#PhotoWay">More...</a></li>
<li>Hike at twilight or under a full moon.
<a href="#HikeWay">More...</a></li>
<li>Catch some sunnies.

</ol>

<div>
 <h3 id="MoonWay">Paddle under the light of a full moon.</h3>
<p>
Join a Three Rivers guided moonlit paddle for a fun and low-cost adventure,
 or if you have your own paddlecraft, explore on your own. Less lake traffic
  at night makes for fewer waves and a more peaceful trip. It also offers
  the opportunity to hear and see wildlife when it tends to be most active.

Recreation Specialist Heather Gordon has been leading full moon paddles for
 several years and says, “We often see birds ‘fishing’ and fish jumping and
  sometimes we see land critters on the water’s edge. We also tend to hear
  more frogs, toads and singing birds than during the day.” Heather loves
   that the moonlight trips offer the opportunity to catch a fabulous
    sunset and moonrise.

<div>
<h3 id="StarWay">See the stars</h3>
<p>
When was the last time you looked up and saw the Milky Way? Sagittarius?
For less light pollution and a great view, visit a restored prairie in a
 park reserve a little further out from the city, such as Crow-Hassan,
  Murphy-Hanrehan or Carver. Bring a blanket, bug spray and star map.
</p>
</div>


<a href="#start">Back</a>

<div>
<h3 id="DateWay">Go on a sunset-viewing date.</h3>
  <p>
  What’s more romantic than watching the sun set together? And it’s
   cheaper and more unique than dinner and a movie. Bring some wine
    (ages 21+), cheese and a checkered tablecloth and you might even
     forget you’re in Minnesota and think you are in a movie.
</p>
</div>

<a href="#start">Back</a>

<div>
<h3 id="PhotoWay"> Try a family photo adventure   </h3>
<p>
  Everything looks a little different through the lens of a camera.
  For a creative way to get a new view of the parks, what about
   capturing landscapes on a photo adventure? You’ll miss the
   harsh glare of the sun and capture changing and interesting light.
    Plus, as wildlife tends to be more active in the evening, you may
    even be able to capture some critter cameos.
</p>
</div>

<a href="#start">Back</a>

<div>
  <h3 id="HikeWay"> Hike at twilight or under a full moon </h3>
<p>
If you want a chance to hear owls hoot or see deer or other animals
 snacking, evening is the best time to adventure through the woods.
  Three Rivers regularly offers low-cost guided hikes, or you can hike
  on your own. You might be amazed at how quickly your eyes adjust
   to the darkness and how much you can see, particularly when the
   moon is full. As always, be safe with secure footwear, a map,
   flashlight and water.
</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3 id="CathnWay"> Catch some sunnies. </h3>
<p>
  It’s well known that fish start looking for dinner at dusk.
  Fishing is available at 17 parks, with accessible fishing piers
   at 10 parks. Enjoy a picnic dinner and then head out on the water
   or set up at a fishing pier. Boat rentals are available until 8 PM
   at certain parks through Labor Day. Be sure to get your fishing
    license ahead of time.
